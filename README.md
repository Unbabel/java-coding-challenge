# Unbabel Java Challenge

Hey :smile:

Welcome to our Java Challenge repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge. We will evaluate the code on the fork.

**FYI:** Please understand that this challenge is not decisive if you are applying to work at [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/jobs). There are no right and wrong answers. This is just an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way.

## Challenge
